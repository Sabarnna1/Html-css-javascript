			Beef
		</div>
		<p>
			Biryani, whilst not unique to Bangladesh, is a spicy rice dish made with meat or fish, rice, potatoes and spices.

			Hugely popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, Bangladeshi biryani is often considered the best in the world.

			In the Bengali region, popular meats include mutton, goat, chicken and beef, but there is such a wide variety of biryani dishes available that you can try.

			A true traditional biryani involves different types of cooking and preparation, as marinated meat is layered with rice, potatoes and spices, the dish is jam packed with flavour.

			You will often find biryani served at special occasions or celebrations such as weddings, but it is also eaten as a regular meal throughout the weak, such is its popularity.

		Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
